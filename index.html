                        General taste
                    </h2>

                    I prefer Series, but some movies are great too. They often don't have that much of a plot, but especially the old classics
                    and trilogies (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix,...) are great choices.

                    <h2>
                        Topics in movies
                    </h2>

                    Movies containing technichal references and Elements are my favourites. Sometimes I like them too, because they use well made special effects, or are done in a creative way.
